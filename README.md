# Linux Security Learning

This repository is a personal learning space where I experiment with Linux security concepts and small automation scripts as I build my foundations in security engineering.

The focus here is not complex tools, but understanding how Linux systems behave, how logs tell a story, and how simple scripts can help with security monitoring.

## What I’m Exploring
- Linux authentication and system logs
- Common security-related events on Linux systems
- Writing small Python scripts to automate simple checks
- Developing a security-first mindset while working with systems

## What’s Inside
- `scripts/auth_log_monitor.py`  
  A simple Python script that scans Linux authentication logs and prints failed login attempts.  
  This helped me understand how login failures are recorded and how they can be monitored programmatically.

## Why This Repo Exists
I created this repository to:
- Learn by doing
- Document my progress openly
- Build confidence working with Linux systems and security logs

This repo will grow gradually as I learn more.
